What I updated (final changes)

B12 verification placeholders added to the <head> of index.html and instructions in README.md for DNS verification and meta token usage. (Search for B12_TOKEN in files.)

Finalised file list & README with explicit publish steps for GitHub Pages and Netlify, and notes about Formspree vs Netlify Forms.

Ensured all pages reference /assets/style.css and /assets/dark.css and include the same B12 meta placeholder for consistency.

=== FILES: about.html, services.html, contact.html, gallery.html ===

Each page includes the same B12 meta placeholder inside <head> and references to assets/style.css and assets/dark.css.

Contact page contains the contact form area; by default it is left unbound so you can choose Formspree or Netlify forms. README explains both options.



---

=== FILE: assets/style.css & assets/dark.css ===

Production-ready CSS files included (light + dark theme). Use link#dark-css.disabled = false to enable dark theme by default if you prefer.



---

=== FILE: assets/logo.svg, assets/whatsapp.png ===

Placeholder logo and WhatsApp icon included. Replace with your official files using the same filenames to avoid changing markup.

=== FILE: README.md (FINAL) ===

ZERO Associate — Website (Final)

What is included

Multi-page static site: index.html, about.html, services.html, contact.html, gallery.html.

Assets: style.css, dark.css, logo.svg, whatsapp.png, optional project images.

B12 verification placeholder already added in the <head> of each HTML file.


B12 verification — two methods (pick one)

1. Meta token (easy)

Paste the token B12 gives you into the <meta name="b12-verification" content="..."> tag in the <head> of index.html (and other pages if requested). Example: <meta name="b12-verification" content="B12_TOKEN_HERE" />



2. DNS TXT (recommended for official domain verification)

Add a TXT record at your DNS provider: Name/Host=@ (or root), Value=b12=YOUR_TOKEN_VALUE.

Propagation typically completes in minutes to a few hours.




Forms — pick one

Netlify Forms: Deploy to Netlify and keep data-netlify="true" on the form. Netlify auto-collects submissions and supports email/Slack/Zapier notifications.

Formspree: Use if you host on GitHub Pages. Replace the form with Formspree action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_ID" to send emails and store entries on Formspree.


Publish to GitHub Pages

1. Create repo: ZERO-ASSOCIATE-SITE.


2. Upload all files to repo root.


3. Settings → Pages → Source: main branch / root → Save.


4. Visit https://<your-username>.github.io/ZERO-ASSOCIATE-SITE/ after ~1–2 minutes.



Publish to Netlify (recommended for forms)

1. Drag & drop the whole site folder into Netlify's Sites area or connect the GitHub repo. Netlify will deploy and collect forms automatically.




---

Final notes

If you provide the B12 token now, I will insert it into every page's <head> and update the README with the exact DNS record snippet.

If you provide your Formspree endpoint (or choose Netlify), I will bind the contact form to that service and add a success redirect page.
